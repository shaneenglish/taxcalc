      <h2>Hillary Clinton</h2>
      <center> <img src="hhttp://cdn.laprensa.com.ni/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/20222252/clinton-750x500.jpg"> </center>

      <br>

      <p>Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has proposed a tax plan that will raise taxes on higher-income tax payers, or the top 1 percent of earners in the United States. Clinton's plan will not change taxes for the bottom 95 percent of tax payers.</p>

      <p>The specifics of Clinton's plan to tax high earners is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Those with an adjusted gross income (AGI) over $5 million will incur a 4 percent surcharge on their income</li>
          <li>Tax filers who make over $1 million will be subject to the "Buffet Rule" wherein they will pay a 30 percent effect tax rate</li>
        </ul>

      <p>As a result, the tax burden of higher-income tax payers will increase, while those who earn lower wages will see little to no change in their taxes by 2017.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Those with incomes above $730,000 in 2015 dollars will have a $78,000 increase in their tax burdens</li>
          <li>Taypayers who earn less than $300,000 will see little to no change in their income after taxes</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Clinton's tax plan will increase federal revenue by an estimated $1.1 trillion between 2016 and 2026. The Tax Policy Center also reports that Clinton's plan will add $2.1 trillion in revenue in the 10 years after the year 2026. </p>

      <p>The bulk of revenue increase in Clinton's plan will come from her three tax provisions aimed at high-income tax payers:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The 28 percent cap on specific deductions and exclusions ($406 billion)</li>
          <li>4 percent surcharge on those who make $5 million ($126 billion)</li>
          <li>30 percent minimum tax on those who earn $1 million ($119 billion)</li>
        </ol>

      <p>Some effects that Clinton's tax plan could have are specified by the Tax Policy Center, but a truncated version of some effects are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The substitution effect: Increased taxes on higher-income individuals will decrease their incentives to work, save and invest</li>
          <li>The income effect: Consumption targets will be harder to reach as a result of lowered tax return to labor, saving and investment ventures. Taypayers may decide to work and save more, thereby leaving less money for leisure and consumer goods</li>
          <li>A more complex tax system by adding three variants of a minimum tax to the individual alternative minimum tax.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Individual Income Tax</h3>

      <p>Here are some of Clinton's proposals concerning individual income tax:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The tax value certain deductions and exclusions will be limited to 28 percent</li>
        <li>Capital gains less than two years old would be taxed at regular rates as "short term gains." Capital gains held for six years or more would have a 23.8 percent rate applied to them</li>
        <li>Elderly family members and those being charged high out-of-pocket health care expenses would earn tax credits</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bernie Sanders</h2>
      <center> <img src="http://www.progressivestoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bernie-Sanders-mrc.jpg"> </center>

      <br>
      <br>

      <p>Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has proposed significant increases in federal income, payroll, business, and estate taxes, as well as two large new excise taxes. He would use the additional revenue to pay for sweeping new government programs, including a federally administered, single-payer health care program; paid family and medical leave; free tuition at public universities and colleges and investments in rebuilding the country’s infrastructure.</p>

      <p>The Sanders tax proposals would increase federal revenue by $15.3 trillion over the first decade and by an additional $25.1 trillion over the next 10 years before accounting for any changes in the cost of federal borrowing or macroeconomic feedback effects.</p>

      <p>The proposal would raise taxes at every income level, but high-income taxpayers would face the biggest increases, both in dollar amount and as a percentage of income.</p>

      <p>Overall, the plan would raise tax burdens by an average of nearly $9,000, thereby lowering average after-tax income by 12.4 percent. The highest-income taxpayers (the top 0.1 percent, or those with income over $3.7 million in 2015 dollars) would experience an average increase in tax burdens of more than $3 million in 2017, nearly 45 percent of their $6.9 million average after-tax income. The middle quintile of the income distribution would see an average tax increase of almost $4,700, or 8.5 percent of their average after-tax income. Those in the bottom quintile would experience smaller tax increases, averaging $165, or 1.3 percent of their average after-tax income.</p>

      <p>The increases in marginal tax rates under the plan would reduce incentives to work, save, and invest. The proposals would also raise the marginal effective tax rate on all new investments, thus significantly reducing incentives to invest and increasing tax distortions in the allocation of capital.</p>

      <h3>Individual Income Tax</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Cap regular income tax rates at 28 percent of taxable income, but create graduated surtaxes based on adjusted gross income (AGI) for higher-income households.

          <ul>
          <li>Retain the bottom four income tax brackets up to the 28 percent bracket, which would become the highest regular income tax bracket.</li>

          <li>Add a surtax based on AGI at graduated rates for high-income households. The surtax would apply to taxpayers with AGI over $200,000. Surtaxes would be the following:</li>

            <ul>
            <li>9 percent on income between $200,000 ($250,000 for couples) 2 and $500,000 (creating a marginal income tax rate of 37 percent for taxpayers in the 28 percent bracket)</li>
            <li>15 percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million (43 percent marginal rate)</li>
            <li>20 percent on income between $2 million and $10 million (48 percent marginal rate)</li>
            <li>24 percent on income above $10 million (52 percent marginal rate)</li>

            </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         </ul>
      <li>Enact a new 2.2 percent surtax on all taxable income (in addition to the tax and surtax described earlier)</li>  <li>Repeal the individual alternative minimum tax (AMT), the personal exemption phaseout (PEP), and the limitation on itemized deductions (the “Pease” limitation)</li>
      <li>Tax capital gains and dividends at the proposed tax rates (including surtaxes) for ordinary income for taxpayers with incomes above the end of the current 28 percent bracket, but retain current reduced rates for long-term gains and qualified dividends for taxpayers with income at or below the current 28 percent bracket threshold</li>
      <li>Modify the rules for like-kind exchanges of appreciated property to broaden the categories of transactions that are treated as taxable realizations of capital gains</li>
      <li>Require that derivatives be marked to market each year and that the resulting gains or losses be taxed as ordinary income</li>

      </li>
      </ul>

     <p>Presidential candidate Donald Trump has proposed tax reforms that would cut taxes at every income level, but high-income taxpayers would receive the biggest cuts, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of income.</p>

      <p>The plan would cut taxes by an average of about $5,100, or about 7 percent of after-tax income for all taxpayers.</p>

      <p>The highest-income 0.1 percent of taxpayers, which are those with incomes over $3.7 million (in 2015), would experience an average tax cut of over $1.3 million in 2017, nearly 19 percent of after-tax income.</p>

      <p>Middle-income households would receive an average tax cut of $2,700, or 4.9 percent of after-tax income.</p>

      <p>Trump’s proposed tax reforms would reduce federal revenue by $9.5 trillion over its first decade and an additional $15.0 trillion over the following 10 years, before accounting for added interest costs or considering macroeconomic feedback effects. Most of the revenue loss would come from individual income tax cuts, but a third would be from the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and the introduction of special rates on pass-through businesses.</p>

      <p>The significant tax rate cuts would boost incentives to work, save, and invest if interest rates do not change. The plan would also reduce some tax distortions in the allocation of capital. However, increased government borrowing would push up interest rates and crowd out private investment, offsetting some or all of the plan’s positive incentive effects. Offsetting a deficit this large would require unprecedented cuts in federal spending.</p>

      <h3>Individual Income Tax</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Collapse the current seven tax brackets, which range from 10 to 39.6 percent, into three brackets of 10, 20, and 25 percent</li>
        <li>Increase the standard deduction to $25,000 for single filers and $50,000 for joint filers in 2015, indexed for inflation thereafter</li>
        <li>Leave personal exemptions unchanged at $4,000 per person in 2015, indexed. TAX POLICY CENTER | URBAN INSTITUTE & BROOKINGS INSTITUTION 1</li>
        <li>Tax dividends and capital gains at a maximum rate of 20 percent</li>
        <li>Limit the tax value of itemized deductions (other than charitable contributions and mortgage interest) and exclusions for employer-provided health insurance and tax-exempt interest</li>
        <li>Increase the phaseout rates for the personal exemption phaseout and the limit on itemized deductions</li>
        <li>Repeal the alternative minimum tax</li>
        <li>Tax carried interest as ordinary business income</li>
        <li>Repeal the exclusion for investment income on life insurance contracts entered into after 2016</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <p>Donald Trump’s stated goals are to provide tax relief for the middle class, simplify the tax code, and grow the American economy, without adding to the debt or deficit, according to the Trump campaign.</p>

      <h2>Marco Rubio</h2>

      <br>
      <br>

      <p>Presidential candidate, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has proposed a combination of individual and business income tax changes that would convert the federal income tax into a cash-flow consumption tax. It would replace most deductions and exemptions with a universal credit; eliminate estate taxes and move the US to a territorial tax system.</p>

      <p>The proposal would cut taxes at every income level, but high-income taxpayers would receive the biggest cuts, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of income. At the individual level, the plan would exempt interest income, dividends and capital gains from tax. It would consolidate the standard deduction, personal exemption, and 10 percent rate bracket into one refundable personal credit and significantly increase the child tax credit for middle- and higher-income families.</p>

      <p>The proposal would reduce federal revenue by $6.8 trillion over the first decade and by an additional $8.0 trillion over the following decade, before accounting for added interest costs or considering macroeconomic feedback effects.</p>

      <p>The plan would cut the average tax bill in 2017 by about $3,150, boosting after-tax income by 4.4 percent.</p>

      <p>High-income taxpayers (0.1 percent of the population, or those with incomes over $3.7 million in 2015) would experience an average tax cut of more than $900,000, 13.6 percent of after-tax income. Households in the middle fifth of the income distribution would receive an average tax cut of almost $1,400, or 2.5 percent of after-tax income. The poorest fifth of households would see their taxes go down an average of about $250, boosting their after tax income by 1.9 percent.</p>

      <p>TThe marginal tax rate cuts would boost incentives to work, save, and invest if interest rates do not change. The plan would reduce the marginal effective tax rate on all new investments to zero or less (for investments eligible for the research and experimentation credit). It would significantly increase the incentive for investment and reduce tax distortions in the allocation of capital. However, increased government borrowing could push up interest rates and crowd out private investment, thereby offsetting some or all of the plan’s positive effects on private investment, unless there are very deep cuts in federal spending.</p>

      <h3>Individual Income Tax</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Collapse the current seven tax brackets, which range from 10 to 39.6 percent, into three brackets of 15,      25, and 35 percent</li>
        <li>Repeal the head of household filing status</li>
        <li>Eliminate taxation of dividends and capital gains accrued after the proposal’s effective date, while imposing a one-time transition tax on unrealized capital gains</li>
        <li>Eliminate both taxes on interest income and deductibility of interest payments (except mortgage interest)</li>
        <li>Create a new, partially refundable child tax credit of up to $2,500 per child. The credit would phase out between $150,000 and $200,000 of adjusted gross income (AGI) for single filers and between $300,000 and $400,000 for joint filers</li>
        <li>Replace the standard deduction, the personal exemption for tax filers (but not exemptions for dependents), and the 10 percent rate bracket with a new $2,000 refundable personal tax credit ($4,000 for joint filers)</li>
        <li>Eliminate all itemized deductions, except for a reformed mortgage interest deduction and a charitable contribution deduction, both of which would be available to all filers</li>
        <li>Replace existing higher education tax incentives with a $2,500 universal credit that would phase out between 400 percent and 500 percent of poverty levels</li>
        <li>Repeal the individual alternative minimum tax</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

      <h2>Ted Cruz</h2>
      <center> <img src="http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ioAy6lKElmX4/v2/750x-1.jpg"> </center>

      <br>
      <br>

     <p>Presidential candidate, Ted Cruz (R-TX) has proposed a tax plan that would accomplish a number of things. His plan includes creating a "flat tax" of 10 percent that would replace graduated individual income tax rates, instead of the current tax brackets ranging from 10 to 39.6 percent.</p>

     <p>Each taxpayer would be allowed to contribute up to $25,000 annually to a new "Universal Savings Account."</p>

    <p>Cruz's tax proposal also includes repealing corporate income tax, payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare and "estate and gift" taxes.</p>

    <p>In an estimate given by the Tax Policy Center, federal revenue would be reduced by $8.6 trillion during the first 10 years and $12.2 trillion in the subsequent 10 years.</p>

    <p>The plan would also cut taxes at every income level, with those at the higher-income levels receiving the biggest tax cuts in dollars and percentage of income.</p>

    <p>Taxes would be cut by an average of about $6,100 or 8.5 percent of after-tax income. The 0.1 percent, or those with incomes over $3.7 million would receive an average tax cut of more than $2 million in 2017. Those earning middle-class wages would receive about $1,800 or 3.2 percent of after-tax income, while very low earners would receive an average of $46 or 0.4 percent of after-tax income.</p>

    <h3>Individual Income Tax</h3>

    <p>Here are some of the main facets of Cruz's individual income tax proposal:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The 10 percent "flat tax"</li>
      <li>Increased deductions for single and joint filers. Single deductions would go up from $6,300 to $10,000 while joint deductions would go up from $12,600 to $20,000. Inflation rates would apply after 2015</li>
      <li>All credits, aside from the child tax credit and EITC would be repealed</li>
      <li>All above-the-line deductions, except those for retirement savings accounts, would be repealed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some of the effects of Cruz's proposal are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>More of the tax burden would be placed on those would are not as well off if a value-added tax (VAT) were to be enacted</li>
      <li>With the expansion of the Earned Income Tax credit, taypayers in the lower 10 percent would see a 4.3 increase in their after-tax income</li>
      <li>Those in the 10th through 70th percentiles would have after-tax increased between 1.2 and 2.4 percent</li>
      <li>Those in the highest income classes would have an after-tax income of 17.4 percent</li>
    </ul>
